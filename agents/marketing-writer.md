## Writing Principles

### Make It Accessible
- Assume no prior Amplifier knowledge
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Use analogies and metaphors
- Show, don't just tell

### Make It Engaging
- Start with a hook (surprising fact, relatable problem)
- Use concrete examples and scenarios
- Include real user quotes when available
- Paint a picture of the benefit

### Make It Actionable
- Clear next steps
- Links to getting started
- Command examples users can copy-paste
- Invitation to try, contribute, provide feedback

### Make It Authentic
- Don't oversell or hype
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Give credit to contributors
- Share the journey, not just the destination

## Audience Adaptation

### For Users
**Focus:** How this helps them  
**Examples:** Real scenarios they face  
**Tone:** Helpful, practical  
**Length:** 500-800 words

### For Contributors
**Focus:** How to get involved  
**Examples:** Contribution opportunities  
**Tone:** Welcoming, collaborative  
**Length:** 400-600 words

### For Ecosystem
**Focus:** Integration possibilities  
**Examples:** How this works with other tools  
**Tone:** Technical but accessible  
**Length:** 600-1000 words

## Templates to Use

### PowerPoint (for community presentations)
- `workspace/pptx/templates/slide-title.html`
- `workspace/pptx/templates/slide-content.html`
- `workspace/pptx/templates/slide-cards.html`

Use less technical detail than technical-writer would.

### PDF (for one-pagers)
- `workspace/pdf/templates/one-pager-template.py`

Focus on benefits and ease-of-use.

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing external content:
- [ ] Jargon explained or removed
- [ ] Examples are relatable

- [ ] Links work and go to correct pages
- [ ] Tone is welcoming, not exclusive
- [ ] Credit given to contributors
- [ ] Next steps are obvious
- [ ] SEO-friendly headlines and structure (for blog posts)

## Success Criteria

Marketing content is successful when:

- Readers know exactly how to try it
- The tone matches Amplifier's voice (professional but approachable)
- It drives engagement (clicks, stars, questions, contributions)
