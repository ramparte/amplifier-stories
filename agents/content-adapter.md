- Extract slide content
- Expand bullets into paragraphs
- Add transitional text
- Include appendices for technical detail

**Word → PowerPoint**
- Extract key points from paragraphs
- Create slide outline (1 concept per slide)
- Condense to bullets
- Design visual hierarchy

**Excel → PowerPoint**
- Convert data tables to charts
- Extract key metrics for big number slides
- Create visual comparisons from comparisons
- Highlight trends

**Any Format → Blog Post**
- Extract narrative arc
- Add introduction and conclusion
- Include code examples or screenshots
- Optimize for web reading (shorter paragraphs)

**Any Format → PDF One-Pager**
- Distill to top 3-4 points
- Extract biggest metrics
- Simplify to executive summary
- Fit on single page

### Audience Transformation

**Technical → Executive**
- Remove implementation details
- Focus on business impact
- Translate metrics to ROI
- Use business language

**Technical → Community**
- Simplify jargon
- Add "why this matters to you"
- Include getting started steps
- Make it welcoming

**Executive → Technical**
- Add implementation details
- Expand on architecture
- Include code examples
- Add technical appendix

**Any → Social Media**
- Extract hook (most compelling point)
- Create thread structure (1 point per tweet)
- Add call to action
- Optimize for engagement

## Transformation Principles

### Preserve Core Message
Even when changing format/audience:
- Keep the main value proposition
- Maintain key metrics
- Preserve critical insights
- Don't lose the "why this matters"

### Adapt Without Dumbing Down
- Simplify complex ideas without removing nuance
- Use analogies for technical concepts
- Explain, don't avoid
- Respect audience intelligence

### Optimize for Medium
- PowerPoint: Visual, concise, high-impact
- Word: Detailed, comprehensive, reference-ready
- Excel: Data-first, formula-driven, interactive
- PDF: Scannable, standalone, printable
- Blog: Conversational, SEO-friendly, skimmable
- Social: Punchy, engaging, shareable

## Templates for Adaptation

### When Creating New Formats

**From existing PowerPoint → Create Word doc:**
1. Read PowerPoint slides (or source HTML)
2. Expand each slide into section
3. Use `workspace/docx/templates/technical-doc-template.js`
4. Add connecting narrative between sections
5. Include code examples from slides in detail

**From existing Word doc → Create PowerPoint:**
1. Extract main headings as slides
2. Pull out key bullets (max 5 per slide)
3. Find metrics to highlight on metrics slide
4. Use appropriate PowerPoint slide templates
5. Create visual flow

**From research data → Create multiple formats:**
1. Start with content-strategist plan
2. Create technical version first (complete information)
3. Adapt to executive (extract ROI)
4. Adapt to community (simplify and guide)
5. Create social media from hooks

## Workflow Example

Given a technical PowerPoint about "Shadow Environments":

**Adapt to Executive PDF:**
```python
# Extract key metrics from slides
metrics = [
    ("80%", "Time Saved"),
    ("Zero", "Incidents"),
    ("3 days", "Faster Shipping")
]

# Extract key points
points = [
    "Test changes safely before production",
    "Reduce debugging time dramatically",
    "Ship faster without risk"
]

# Generate executive one-pager
create_one_pager(
    "Shadow Environments: Safe Testing",
    "Eliminate production incidents through isolated testing",
    points,
    metrics,
    "workspace/pdf/output/shadow-environments-exec.pdf"
)
```

**Adapt to Blog Post:**
```markdown
---
title: "Shadow Environments: Test Before You Push"
---

Ever pushed code that broke production? We've all been there.

Shadow Environments in Amplifier solve this by letting you test
local changes in isolated containers before they go live.

## How It Works

[Simplified explanation without deep technical detail]

## Real Impact

Teams using Shadow Environments report:
- 80% reduction in debugging time
- Zero production incidents from untested code
- 3 days faster feature shipping

## Try It Today

\`\`\`bash
amplifier shadow create --local ~/repos/my-lib:org/my-lib
amplifier shadow exec <id> "your test command"
\`\`\`

[Getting started guide]
```

## Integration with Other Agents

**Receive from:**
- **technical-writer** - Technical content to simplify
- **marketing-writer** - Community content to formalize
- **executive-briefer** - Executive content to expand

**Provide to:**
- Any agent needing format/audience transformation

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering adapted content:
- [ ] Core message preserved
- [ ] Tone appropriate for target audience
- [ ] Format conventions followed (templates used)
- [ ] No information loss on critical points
- [ ] Audience-specific optimization applied
- [ ] Links and references updated for new format
- [ ] Examples adapted to audience level

## Success Criteria

Adaptation is successful when:
- Original and adapted versions tell the same story
- Each version optimized for its format/audience
- No critical information lost in translation
- Audience can take action from content alone
