# Future Deck Topics

Ideas for future presentations, organized by theme.

## Cool Amplifier Features

Small polish and UX improvements that could be combined into a single "quality of life" deck:

- **Recipe Cancellation** - Graceful Ctrl+C handling with resume support. One Ctrl+C finishes current step, two stops immediately. State preserved for resume.
- **Automatic Session Naming** - Sessions name themselves based on conversation content. No more "session-abc123".
- **Hook Inheritance for Sub-agents** - Sub-agents can inherit hooks from parent sessions (logging, notifications, policies).
- **Context Inheritance for Sub-agents** - Pass conversation history to sub-agents so they don't start fresh.

## Potential Standalone Decks

Larger features that might warrant their own deck:

- **Amplifier Profiles** - User preference management
- **Recipe System Deep Dive** - Full walkthrough of recipe capabilities
- **Bundle Composition** - How bundles are built and composed
- **MCP Integration** - Model Context Protocol support

## Showcase Projects (Built with Amplifier)
